## Milestone 0 — Project Bootstrap

> Set up the solution structure, Docker skeleton, HTTPS proxy, database connection, and a working health check endpoint.

📄 [Full milestone README](milestones/M0%20-%20Project%20Bootstrap/README.md)

**Depends on:** Nothing — start here.

### Tasks

- [ ] Create solution `Spoolarr.sln` with `Spoolarr.Api` and `Spoolarr.Web` projects
- [ ] Set up Docker + docker-compose skeleton
- [ ] Configure Caddy for HTTPS
- [ ] Set up EF Core + SQLite + `FilamentDbContext`
- [ ] Basic health check endpoint `GET /health`

---

## Milestone 1 — Data Model

> Define the database entities, run EF Core migrations, set up repositories, and seed test data.

📄 [Full milestone README](milestones/M1-data-model/README.md)

**Depends on:** M0

### Tasks

- [x] `Spool`, `Printer`, `PrintJob`, `NfcTag` entity classes
- [x] EF Core migrations — `InitialCreate` applied, all 4 tables created
- [x] `ISpoolRepository`, `IPrinterRepository`, `IPrintJobRepository`, `INfcTagRepository` + implementations
- [x] All 4 repositories registered in DI
- [x] `SeedData` — 2 spools, 1 NFC tag, 1 printer on first run
- [x] Auto-migration and error handling on startup

---

## Milestone 2 — Spool API

> Build the REST API endpoints for managing spools — list, get, register, activate, and update weight.

📄 [Full milestone README](milestones/M2-spool-api/README.md)

**Depends on:** M0, M1

### Tasks

- [ ] `GET /api/spools` — list all spools
- [ ] `GET /api/spools/{id}` — get single spool
- [ ] `POST /api/spools` — register new spool
- [ ] `PATCH /api/spools/{id}/activate` — set active spool
- [ ] `PATCH /api/spools/{id}/weight` — update weight manually

---

## Milestone 3 — NFC Scan Flow

> Handle the NFC tag scan event — look up the tag UID, route to register or activate, and push the result to the browser in real time via SignalR.

📄 [Full milestone README](milestones/M3-nfc-scan/README.md)

**Depends on:** M0, M1, M2

### Tasks

- [ ] `POST /api/spools/scan` — receives tag UID, routes to register or activate
- [ ] `NfcScanService` — lookup by UID, return spool or "unknown tag"
- [ ] `NfcScanHub` SignalR — push scan result to browser in real time

---

## Milestone 4 — Bambu MQTT

> Connect to the Bambu Lab printer on the local network via MQTT, listen for print-finish events, extract grams used, and automatically deduct from the active spool.

📄 [Full milestone README](milestones/M4-bambu-mqtt/README.md)

**Depends on:** M0, M1, M2

### Tasks

- [ ] `MqttListenerService` as `IHostedService`
- [ ] Connect to printer on LAN using MQTTnet
- [ ] Parse print-finish event, extract grams used
- [ ] Deduct grams from active spool via `SpoolService`
- [ ] Log `PrintJob` to DB

---

## Milestone 5 — Web UI

> Build the browser-based dashboard — spool list, spool detail, NFC scan page, register form, and active spool indicator.

📄 [Full milestone README](milestones/M5-web-ui/README.md)

**Depends on:** M2, M3

### Tasks

- [ ] Spool list dashboard
- [ ] Spool detail page
- [ ] NFC scan page (Web NFC + QR fallback for iOS)
- [ ] Register spool form
- [ ] Active spool indicator

---

## Milestone 6 — Alerts

> Trigger a push notification when a spool's remaining weight drops below its threshold after a print.

📄 [Full milestone README](milestones/M6-alerts/README.md)

**Depends on:** M4

### Tasks

- [ ] Threshold check after every gram deduction
- [ ] Webhook / ntfy push notification

---

## Milestone 7 — AMS Support

> Extend Spoolarr to support the Bambu Lab AMS — track up to 4 filament slots simultaneously and map each MQTT print event to the correct spool.

📄 [Full milestone README](milestones/M7-ams/README.md)

**Depends on:** M1, M2, M4

### Tasks

- [ ] Slot-to-spool mapping model
- [ ] Multi-slot MQTT parsing
- [ ] UI slot management

---

## Milestone 8 — Docker & Deployment

> Containerize the API with Docker, add a Caddy HTTPS reverse proxy, and verify the full stack runs correctly inside Docker.

📄 [Full milestone README](milestones/M8-docker/README.md)

**Depends on:** M0

### Tasks

- [ ] Write `docker-compose.yml` with API service and SQLite volume
- [ ] Write `Caddyfile` for HTTPS reverse proxy
- [ ] Add Caddy service to `docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] Configure environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] Verify `docker compose up --build` runs without errors
